 *       not yet landed in the loaded roster (just-created / mid-reload —
 *       `resolveSelectedWorld` deliberately returns undefined here rather than
 *       impersonating `worlds[0]`). Here the roster is world-scoped, we simply do
 *       not have its members yet, so the honest answer is EMPTY (loading) — NOT
 *       the global pool, which would ghost the prior world's cast beside an empty
 *       世界状态 角色 panel (the bug this fixes).
 *
 * `selectedWorldId` disambiguates the two: a present id with an unresolved `world`
 * is case (b) → `[]`; only an absent id with an unresolved `world` is case (a) →
 * full pool. The id is used purely as a "a world is selected" presence flag; the
